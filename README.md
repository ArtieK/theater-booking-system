## 🛠️ Running the Project

### 1️⃣ Load Schema
```bash
psql -U postgres -d theater_db -f schema.sql
```

### 2️⃣ Load Sample Data
In order:
```bash
psql -U postgres -d theater_db -f data_reorganized_step1.sql
psql -U postgres -d theater_db -f data_reorganized_step2.sql
psql -U postgres -d theater_db -f data_reorganized_step3.sql
psql -U postgres -d theater_db -f data_reorganized_step4.sql
psql -U postgres -d theater_db -f data_reorganized_step5.sql
```
Or combine them:
```bash
cat data_reorganized_step*.sql > data_full.sql
psql -U postgres -d theater_db -f data_full.sql
```

### 3️⃣ Load Logic (Triggers & Functions)
```bash
psql -U postgres -d theater_db -f logic.sql
```

### 4️⃣ Run Queries
```bash
psql -U postgres -d theater_db -f queries.sql
```

## ⚙️ Assumptions & Notes

- Booking records **link seats and performances directly**, so no separate `PerformanceSeat` table was needed.
- `Booking.final_price` is calculated automatically via a trigger based on `price_factor`.
- Bookings are **not allowed within 3 days** of a performance (enforced via trigger).
- Club seat allocation is tracked per performance using `ClubSeatAllocation`.
- Sample data includes 5 plays, 10 performances, 8 members, 15 seats, and more than 20 bookings.
- Assumes base ticket price of `$20.00` in pricing logic (adjustable in `apply_dynamic_pricing()`).
